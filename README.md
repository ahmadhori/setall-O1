# set-all-O(1)

Data structure which allow to set all values in it with complexity of O(1).

## this is the description of the challenge:

build a data structure which contains the following operations<br  />

- set(index, x) -> will set the value at the index to x
- get(index) -> will get the value at index
- set_all(x) -> will set all the values in the datastructure to x<br  />

**Note:** all those operation should be done with the complexity of O(1)
